Help for AKICK:

The AKICK command allows you to maintain channel
ban lists.  Users on the AKICK list will be
automatically kickbanned when they join the channel,
removing any matching ban exceptions first. Users
with the +r flag are exempt.

You may also specify a hostmask (nick!user@host)
for the AKICK list.

Removing an entry from the AKICK list will not
remove any channel bans placed by it.

The reason is used when kicking and is visible in
AKICK LIST. If the reason contains a '|' character,
everything after it does not appear in kick reasons
but does appear in AKICK LIST.

Syntax: AKICK <#channel> ADD|DEL|LIST <nickname|hostmask> [reason]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& AKICK #foo ADD bar you are annoying | private op info
    /msg &nick& AKICK #foo ADD *!*foo@bar.com
    /msg &nick& AKICK #foo DEL bar
    /msg &nick& AKICK #foo LIST
