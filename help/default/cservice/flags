Help for FLAGS:

The FLAGS command allows for the granting/removal of channel
privileges on a more specific, non-generalized level. It
supports nicknames, groups and hostmasks as targets.

When only the channel argument is given, a listing of
permissions granted to users will be displayed.

Syntax: FLAGS <#channel>

Otherwise, an access entry is modified. A modification may be
specified by a template name (changes the access to the
template) or a flags change (starts with + or -). See the
TEMPLATE help entry for more information about templates.

#if !halfops
If you are not a founder, you may only manipulate flags you
have yourself, and may not edit users that have flags you
don't have. For this purpose, +v grants +V, +o grants +O
and +r grants +b.
#else
If you are not a founder, you may only manipulate flags you
have yourself, and may not edit users that have flags you
don't have. For this purpose, +v grants +V, +h grants +H,
+o grants +O and +r grants +b.
#endif

#if module chanserv/set_limitflags
If the LIMITFLAGS option is set for the channel, this is
restricted further, see help for SET LIMITFLAGS.

#endif
If you do not have +f you may still remove your own access
with -*.
