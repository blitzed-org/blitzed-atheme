GENERAL
-------

- Blitzed SHA1 hashes require > 51 bytes. This requires changing
  Atheme's common.h PASSLEN field to something more like 80.

- The rawsha1 module in atheme does not support salt. A 
  new saltedsha1 module has been created to support Blitzed 
  salted hashes.

NICKSERV
--------

- Blitzed linked nicks are are full fledged nick registrations. 
  Atheme linked nicks are 'grouped' to an 'account', and inherit 
  the account's properties.

  Any children nicks in blitzed have been linked to their 
  parent nick. This means that any meta data (e.g. flags) 
  the child have are lost. They will inherit the settings 
  of their parent.

- URLs associated with Blitzed nicks have been converted to 
  meta data fields on the nick of type 'url'.

- Both the access and enforce module need to be enabled for 
  blitzed style access and enforce lists.

- Blitzed has a "access list number" that was lost when converting 
  to atheme format. Atheme has ACCESS DEL <mask> instead of 
  ACCESS DEL <num> like blitzed. 

- SET HIDE EMAIL has been converted to SET HIDEMAIL
- SET OPER no longer exists
