GENERAL
-------

- Blitzed SHA1 hashes require > 51 bytes. This requires changing
  Atheme's common.h PASSLEN field to something more like 80.

- The rawsha1 module in atheme does not support salt. A 
  new saltedsha1 module has been created to support Blitzed 
  salted hashes.

NICKSERV
--------

- Blitzed linked nicks are are full fledged nick registrations. 
  Atheme linked nicks are 'grouped' to an 'account', and inherit 
  the account's properties.

  Any children nicks in blitzed have been linked to their 
  parent nick. This means that any meta data (e.g. flags) 
  the child have are lost. They will inherit the settings 
  of their parent.

- URLs associated with Blitzed nicks have been converted to 
  meta data fields on the nick of type 'url'.

- Both the access and enforce module need to be enabled for 
  blitzed style access and enforce lists.

- Blitzed has a "access list number" that was lost when converting 
  to atheme format. Atheme has ACCESS DEL <mask> instead of 
  ACCESS DEL <num> like blitzed. 

- SENDPASS exists as a module, but there is no SET SENDPASS to 
  allow or deny on a nick

- AUTOJOIN no longer exists

- FORBID exists on Atheme, but unlike Blitzed it's reversible. Blitzed 
  drops all useful meta data on a user before forbidding them. Because 
  of this, the forbidden nicks were not converted.

- SET HIDEEMAIL, EMAIL, ENFORCE, NOOP
   have been converted
- SET PRIVATE has changed. The old functionality no longer 
  applies, because nick lists are hidden.
- SET HIDE has been converted to the new SET PRIVATE. Any user 
  with SET HIDE on MASK or QUIT will have SET PRIVATE set on
  the converted account. 
- SET COORDS is now a property 'coords'. This could be pulled into 
  a module for easier setting
- SET IRCOP  no longer exists
- SET SECURE no longer exists and is implicitly on for all users
- SET HIDE no longer exists
- SET SENDPASS no longer exists, but SET MARK will protect an 
  account from being sendpassed or set pass, unless FORCE is
  used on the SENDPASS command. 
- SET AUTOJOIN no longer exists
- SET NOEXPIRE is now SET HOLD. Any users with SET IRCOP have 
  a SET HOLD flag added on conversion. Marked accounts are not 
  exempt from expiration.
- SET REGTIME no longer exists
- SET LANGUAGE exists, but the only targets are currently en. All 
  accounts will be converted to English.
- FORBID is a contrib module. The data has been converted over, 
  with a forbider of "services", a forbid time of now(), and 
  the original forbid reason.
- SUSPEND is now SET FREEZE, and these data have not been converted. 

CHANSERV
--------

- MLOCK +R is now +r
- MLOCK +O needs charybdis extensions/chm_operonly.c +O 
 
- SET SECURE is implied
- SET SECUREOPS is now SET SECURE
- SET LEAVEOPS no longer exists

- The AKICK level has been deprecated and AKICK set access in 
  atheme is given to anyway with ACL change access. Anyone with 
  AKICK access is given the +r flag
- The UNBAN level is deprecated, and cannot be carried over because 
  UNBAN -and- BAN are combined in atheme as the +r flag.
- LEVEL LIST and LEVEL CHANGE are deprecated
- SYNC command is deprecated
- KICK access is deprecated and now falls under +r

- Flags for all nicks associated with an account are combined.
  Because of this combining, modification times for these flags 
  are set to now()
- Founder gets flags +AFORfiorstv
- Access flags for channel access lists for each user are created 
  based on the user's original level, and the level settings 
  for their channel

MEMOSERV
--------

- Blitzed does not keep track of memo read state, but Atheme does.
  On conversion, all memos have been marked READ.
